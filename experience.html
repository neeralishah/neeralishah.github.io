          <h3>Purdue Computer Science</h3>
          <h4>CS193 TA</h4>
          <p>
            This course revolves around teaching tools such as Linux commands,
            git, and team building activities to ensure the first-year students
            in Computer Science and Data Science are equipped for their courses.
            My role consists of working on curriculum development, grading, and
            holding office hours for all 500 first-year students in CS and DS.

          <h3>Girls Who Code</h3>
          <h4>Teaching Assistant</h4>
          <p>
            I taught over 115 high school girls the fundamentals of programming.
            The teaching team and I facilitated panels between girls in program
            and CEOs of companies including Twitter, Blackrock, Pepsi, and AT&T.
            We delivered intensive teaching in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and helped
            the girls built a personal website in 2 weeks.

          <h3>CS Organization Involvement</h3>
          <h4>Founder & President of Girls Who Code College Loops at Purdue</h4>
          <p>
            Currently working on founding Purdue‚Äôs first College Loops program.
            We hope to utilize the curriculum given by Girls Who Code to support
            aspiring k-12 students in their endeavors into tech. Purdue is a
            great engineering university and adjuncting our experience from
            school with the resources from GWC, I believe we have potential to
            create a community of women in CS outside of our university and give
            back to the greater Lafayette area. When I was introduced to CS it
            was an experience that left me feeling more confident and curious -
            a feeling I hope others can experience and one that drives me to
            make this program its finest.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Webmaster of Computer Science Women's Network</h4>
          <p>
            Implemented new features to the organizations website including
            member login portal, integration of Calendly calendar, and
            embedding/creating a recruitment video.
          </p>

          <h4>Secretary of Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board</h4>
          <p>
            I serve with 3 others on the exec team, and 19 others on the board
            to ensure the best experience for students in the Computer Science
            department. We work on initiatives like tutoring, mentorship, CS193,
            and acting as liaisons between students and faculty through Town
            Hall.
